# Easyplant

This is an adaptation of the built-in plant component, that allows for easier configuration.

- Sensors are automatically discovered and assocated with the correct plants (by naming convention)
- Handles multiple sensors for the same reading (useful for redundancy on multiple ESPHome nodes)
- Can pull data from a plant database (CSV, search on GitHub for it)

More detailed REAMDE to come.
